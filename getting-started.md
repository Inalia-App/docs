# Getting started

Inalia has two parts:

- The web app, [inalia.app](https://inalia.app), where we create and configure talks.
- The Slidev addon, [slidev-addon-inalia](./slidev-addon-inalia), which communicates with the web app from the presentation and displays interactive elements.

Before continuing, create an account on [inalia.app](https://inalia.app). A **free plan** is available.

In this guide we create a simple talk with one question to demonstrate how Inalia works.

## Inalia

The [Inalia web app](https://inalia.app) lets us create and configure talks through a simple interface for managing interactive presentation elements.

Create a new talk by clicking the "Create Talk" button, then complete the form with your talk details.

After creation, the app redirects us to the talk details page, where we manage settings and add interactive elements. For this guide we focus on the questions section.

Create a question by clicking the "Create Question" button in the questions section and completing the form â€” we'll use a simple text question for this example.

For a broader overview, see the [architecture documentation](./architecture.md).

## Slidev

Now that our talk is ready on [inalia.app](https://inalia.app), we can create a Slidev project and add the Inalia addon.

```sh
pnpm create slidev@latest
```

Change into the new project folder and run the Slidev addon CLI to install and configure the addon:

```sh
npx slidev-addon-inalia
```

The CLI prompts a few questions, then installs the required dependencies and applies the configuration.

See the Slidev addon documentation for more details: [slidev-addon-inalia](./slidev-addon-inalia.md).
