# Demo Mode

While building your presentation, you might want to check if all your Inalia integrations are working as expected. Inalia provides a demo mode that allows you interact with your talk without persisting any data.

You can enable and disable demo mode from the Inalia Dashboard and from the SliDev navigation bar.

> [!NOTE]
> Demo mode is unrelated to the state of your talk (disabled, running, finished). Slides must be running to interact with Inalia components, even in demo mode.
